Iamsodarncool: sorry ben I forgot I had work! compiling now
Iamsodarncool: aaand sent
NooNoo: Ill check it out after this raid
NooNoo: Ddo you want it in a ddoc or something
Iamsodarncool: thumbs up emoji
NooNoo is now playing Rust. Click here to join.
Iamsodarncool: just message me whenever something breaks
NooNoo: If you jump repeadetly you bounce
NooNoo: Like if I double jump I will bounce ocne when I hit the ground
Iamsodarncool: you mean how pressing jump in midair makes you jump on landing?
NooNoo: yes
Iamsodarncool: intended behavior, part of the USA first person controller
NooNoo: oh ok
Iamsodarncool: its purpose is for if you press it RIGHT before landing. I agree it's weird and later I'll be adjusting it
NooNoo: Yeah just make it only apply if the distance between the character and the groundd is whatever units
NooNoo: The options button doesnt work
NooNoo: in game
NooNoo: neither does about
Iamsodarncool: yeah I know, haven't got to that yet
Iamsodarncool: sorry I meant to tell you
NooNoo: Its WASD
NooNoo: Not WSAD
NooNoo: gosh jimmy
Iamsodarncool: will fix thanks ben
NooNoo: Hooking an inverter to istelf causes it to flash "current"
NooNoo: which is maybe intendded
Iamsodarncool: it is
Iamsodarncool: how would you expect it to behave?
NooNoo: Lock up?
NooNoo: I guess logically it makes sense
NooNoo: Im not uite sure what you want me to break considering everythingf I have said is intended
Iamsodarncool: no I'm glad for the feedback, it's good to know what players dont expect
Iamsodarncool: keep fucking with circuits, try to get behavior that defies logic. Save and load games and try to get it to break on load
Iamsodarncool: mess with placing circuitboards, that's a pretty complex system
NooNoo: The one thing i find which is odd
NooNoo: well idk about odd but
NooNoo: if you put buttons or inverters or whatever beside eachother
NooNoo: you can cover the outputs
NooNoo: with the models
NooNoo: Jimmy how do I save
Iamsodarncool: yeah I'm not happy about that but it's complex to fix
Iamsodarncool: it autosaves every ten seconds and will manually trigger a save when you quit to desktop or title or if the program is forcibly quit
Iamsodarncool: you can change the autosave interval in settings.txt if you wish
NooNoo: you should say that or have a sort of disclaimer
Iamsodarncool: good idea
Iamsodarncool: I'll also make it save on pause and have text on the pause screen that says "game saved!"
NooNoo: You can place a board off of another board into yourself
Iamsodarncool: does that make it glitch
NooNoo: you cant move
NooNoo: I mean you can just delete it
NooNoo: but you get stuck in the board
Iamsodarncool: hm okay
Iamsodarncool: I'll try to fix but it might be tricky
Iamsodarncool: thank you
NooNoo: after placing a board your cursor stays on screen
Iamsodarncool: oh dear
NooNoo: untill you click again
Iamsodarncool: that's odd, I cannot reproduce this
Iamsodarncool: you mean placing via left click right? when the board is highlighted green but the click gets rid of the highlight?
NooNoo: Once I placed a board with negative values my curos got stuck on my screen
NooNoo: oh yeah, you can use negative values
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmcbb
Iamsodarncool: oh shit I didn't consider negative values
NooNoo: which causes some to phase through others creating weird graphical effects
NooNoo: aswell as the "recessed" board on the bottom left
Iamsodarncool: yeah that is fuckin weird
Iamsodarncool: fixing now
NooNoo: Just a ease of use thing
NooNoo: dont close the color menu when I apply 1 color
NooNoo: if im going to color code I probably want to color code my whole board
Iamsodarncool: double tapping v will apply the previously applied color
Iamsodarncool: since the first tap opens the color menu and the second tap applies it
NooNoo: Yes, but you have to realize I am an idiot
Iamsodarncool: haha
NooNoo: Also I crashed your game
Iamsodarncool: aw fuck
Iamsodarncool: how?
NooNoo: I made a board 10 by 100000000000000000000000000000000
NooNoo: if you do not choose a name the file is just called "       "
NooNoo: maybe defualt to a "newGame"
Iamsodarncool: ah good idea
NooNoo: Double Bufferedd setting onder vsync crops into the single buffered space
NooNoo: Show fps doesnt show my FPS
Iamsodarncool: show fps only works in game not the main menu, is that the issue?
Iamsodarncool: vsync dropdown looks fine to me, can you share a screenshot?
NooNoo: Ohhhhh my fps was over a mountain
NooNoo: the colors match perfectly
Iamsodarncool: ah so they do
Iamsodarncool: I'll up the contrast
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmdpa
NooNoo: same with AA
Iamsodarncool: oh that's how it looks on mine too. You're right it should be sapced out
Iamsodarncool: spaced
NooNoo: crashed your game
NooNoo: If you have a very long save name
Iamsodarncool: dammit
NooNoo: when it goes to save it crashes
NooNoo: i did

426 427 428 429 430 431 43
Iamsodarncool: ah, the file path will be invalid I suspect
NooNoo: all the way to 1000
NooNoo: andd it crashed
NooNoo: probably just limit the length of save names
Iamsodarncool: thank you, I'll cap it yes
NooNoo: hitting delete game with no game selected will still bring up the "are you sure screen"
NooNoo: Also, for friday I cant spell posistion
Iamsodarncool: thanks
Iamsodarncool: lol
Iamsodarncool: we'll make do
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmepu
NooNoo: Is assume this is incorrect
Iamsodarncool: what, the logo being cut off?
NooNoo: The banner
NooNoo: right
NooNoo: I only see Ga
Iamsodarncool: yeah I haven't bothered fixing it since it's just a placeholder. Brooke is working on the final logo now
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmfda
NooNoo: I cant place this board
NooNoo: even though ive had other board dintersect before
Iamsodarncool: you should not have had other board intersect. You should not be able to place a board if it's intersecting with something
Iamsodarncool: were the other inside boards the glitchy negative ones?
NooNoo: probably
NooNoo: are through poles intended dto go through multiple boards
Iamsodarncool: the through pegs?
NooNoo: yes
Iamsodarncool: not explicitly but I don't mind
NooNoo: okay
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmfsl
Iamsodarncool: do some more testing with board intersections. If you've done it before they might be broken under specific circumstances
Iamsodarncool: yeah that looks odd but fixin it would be as complex as the clipped outputs thing. I don't mind it for now
NooNoo: Ok this is really weird
NooNoo: I went to move a board
NooNoo: and now its stuck out of place seemingly randomly
Iamsodarncool: oh god
NooNoo: and It wont let me deselect, cancel or place it
Iamsodarncool: what do you mean by "stuck out of place seemingly randomly"?
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmfsl
NooNoo: basically
NooNoo: the board on the left snapped to the end of the board at the bottom right of the frame
NooNoo: and then couldnt be moved untill I reloaded the game
Iamsodarncool: you sent the same screenshot as last time was that intentional
NooNoo: just to show you which boards i was alking about
Iamsodarncool: ok
Iamsodarncool: see if you can find steps to reproduce
Iamsodarncool: I suspect it might have something to do with placing more boards on the parent board
NooNoo: you can move boards into the groundd
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmgn8
Iamsodarncool: intentional, otherwise it would be impossible to place boards on uneven terrain
Iamsodarncool: but I agree it displeases me the extent to which they can be buried
NooNoo: but why is there that graphical glitch extending perpendicular to the board
Iamsodarncool: z-fighting. The board and the terrain are exactly lined up and the graphics API isn't sure which surface to render on top of the other
NooNoo: Interesting I never knew that
Iamsodarncool: indeed
Iamsodarncool: it also happens if you have to crossing wires at the same altitude and have one on one off
Iamsodarncool: *two
NooNoo: it would be nice to be able to pain sections of a board
NooNoo: or even components
Iamsodarncool: re: the first one, make smaller boards and stick them together
Iamsodarncool: for the second one I want board objects to be quickly identifiable, and part of that is consistent color
Iamsodarncool: I'd like to have colored text on labels though that'd be nice
NooNoo: it bothers me there is no crouch
NooNoo: I mean you dont NEED it
Iamsodarncool: I was gonna say haha why would you ever crouch :)
NooNoo: For circuits near the ground
NooNoo: Or if I prefer to work top down
Iamsodarncool: true!
Iamsodarncool: When I rewrite the first person controls I'll be sure to add it (in addition to the jump thing)
NooNoo: If you tab back in
NooNoo: the first few times you try to lock the selection menu it doesnt stay locked
Iamsodarncool: really? that's odd
NooNoo: I have to hold for probably 2-3 seconds
Iamsodarncool: what causes it to unlock? it works just fine for me
Iamsodarncool: you have to press ctrl before pressing c not the other way around, is that it?
NooNoo: I actually cant get it to lock at all now
Iamsodarncool: shit
Iamsodarncool: I've been unable to become unable to lock it, do you know exactly what to do to cause it?
NooNoo: tab out
NooNoo: tab back in
NooNoo: i physically can not lock the menu now
Iamsodarncool: cannot reproduce
NooNoo: to be fair i locked dand locked it probably 20- 30 times
Iamsodarncool: I assume it goes away if you reload the save?
Iamsodarncool: I'll try doing that
Iamsodarncool: yeah cannot reproduce at all
NooNoo: but yeah
NooNoo: across muiltiple saves
NooNoo: tab out and then click back in
NooNoo: I cannot for the life of me get it to lock
Iamsodarncool: oh CLICK back in
Iamsodarncool: I've been tabbing back in
Iamsodarncool: is the game paused while you do this?
NooNoo: no
Iamsodarncool: still cannot reproduce...
Iamsodarncool: is your ctrl key broken
NooNoo: no jimmy
NooNoo: because i can copy and paste
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
NooNoo: Jimmy
Jimmy
Iamsodarncool: well heck I don't know
Iamsodarncool: maybe it does have to do with copy pasting though? maybe some text is selected and it's copying it instead of doing the menu thing? hmm
NooNoo: Also i cant figure out why this wont connect
Iamsodarncool: but that wouldn't persist accross multiple saves
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmkh0
Iamsodarncool: I think the line of sight is JUST broken by the corner of the cube
NooNoo: Fair
NooNoo: ok so
NooNoo: the power can go through the display correct
Iamsodarncool: yes, display input acts just like any other peg
NooNoo: so then why does this not provide power to the left most delay
Iamsodarncool: screenshot
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmlg6
Iamsodarncool: the display peg is feeding into the OUTPUT of the display
Iamsodarncool: outputs cannot recieve power
Iamsodarncool: they are the square ones
NooNoo: well I know that not
NooNoo: now*
NooNoo: xD
Iamsodarncool: good try ben
NooNoo: Ok i got a real thing now
Iamsodarncool: shoot
NooNoo: you cant link inverters to switches or buttons if theres only one tile between then
Iamsodarncool: screenshot? I just tested and it works fine for me
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmm9g
Iamsodarncool: you are trying to connect two outputs ben :)
NooNoo: by why can I not have a button dork like this
Iamsodarncool: the only valid connections are those between an input and another input and an input and output
Iamsodarncool: I don't know why can you not have a button dork like that
Iamsodarncool: you can connect the button to the top of the inverter, yes?
NooNoo: but really what if I wanted the inversion of the button while also using the button for something else
NooNoo: and yes i can
Iamsodarncool: you can do multiple connections to a single output, they all just have to connect to inputs
Iamsodarncool: put a peg down next to the inverter and connect it to the button
NooNoo: Okay
NooNoo: im having an issue with long connections
Iamsodarncool: there is a maximum distance, is that what you mean?
NooNoo: tell me these things jimmy
Iamsodarncool: haha sorry
Iamsodarncool: there's also a maximum distance beyond which the player cannot reach
Iamsodarncool: no 360 nohelpmenus accross the map
NooNoo: HA I FINNALY GOT AN ACTUAL ISSUE
NooNoo: you can place boards through wire
Iamsodarncool: yes!!
Iamsodarncool: screenshot?
Iamsodarncool: thought I fixed that
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmp1s
Iamsodarncool: heck
Iamsodarncool: yeah it appears at some point my DestroyIntersectingConnections method broke. You can also place board objects inside wires and they won't break
NooNoo: Hey im useful
NooNoo: but annoying
Iamsodarncool: yes you are useful!!! I've been fixing and improving stuff throughout this whole conversation!
Iamsodarncool: seriously, thank you so much for the feedback ben. this is the first time anyone but me has played the game for more than 2 minutes and it's immensely useful
NooNoo: Why would oyu ever select none
Iamsodarncool: in the board menu?
NooNoo: yes
Iamsodarncool: if you opened it by accident
Iamsodarncool: I'll rename it to cancel
NooNoo: but even then right
NooNoo: when else are oyu left clicking
Iamsodarncool: what?
NooNoo: Why would anyone ever take the time to select none
NooNoo: when they could just leave it and select the next thing they need
NooNoo: like when do you ever left click
Iamsodarncool: switches and buttons
NooNoo: but slecting an inverter while you interact with a button doesn nothing
NooNoo: Replace inverter with any itewm
Iamsodarncool: it's insurance in case you misclick so you don't accidentally place anything
NooNoo: did oyu know you can climb trees
Iamsodarncool: yup
Iamsodarncool: and sheer cliff faces
NooNoo: While HOLD C makes sense
NooNoo: click and drag sounds better for the connecting instructions
Iamsodarncool: yes idkwtf I was thinking with that wording thank you
NooNoo: JIMMY
NooNoo: I broke it again
Iamsodarncool: NOOO
NooNoo: If you make a death spiral
NooNoo: with displays
Iamsodarncool: what
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmrnv
NooNoo: if you stand in the middle
NooNoo: and keep turning placing them closer andd closer
NooNoo: you either A. Pop out into the air
NooNoo: or B. get forced through the floor
Iamsodarncool: the second one is a problem
NooNoo: done it 4 times now
Iamsodarncool: shite
NooNoo: seems to be if you place one infront of you with now room to get pushed backwards
Iamsodarncool: honestly I'm just going to say "reload the game" for now
Iamsodarncool: yeah, when I redo the board object placing to be more like board placing I'll make it so you can't place objects inside you
NooNoo: yeah reloaded the game and save
NooNoo: still possibler
Iamsodarncool: as in reloading will make you no longer falling out of the world
Iamsodarncool: I assume that's what you mean by forced through the floor
NooNoo: I can still force myself through the floor
Iamsodarncool: annoying
Iamsodarncool: that makes you fall out of the world right?
NooNoo: yes
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmspb
Iamsodarncool: ok
Iamsodarncool: won't fix for now since you can just reload and it's not something you could ever really do by accident...
Iamsodarncool: thank you for finding it though
NooNoo: also
NooNoo: similar to the delete issue
NooNoo: you can rename a save without a save selected
Iamsodarncool: ah
Iamsodarncool: will fix thank you
NooNoo: Names with ? will not save
NooNoo: they just dont show up in the load save menu
NooNoo: I lied
NooNoo: they show up as ______
NooNoo: any forbidden character is displayed as ____
Iamsodarncool: that's intended behavior
NooNoo: oh makes sense makes sense
NooNoo: Also idk if intended or not but see through board mode doesnt work if you stack 3 or more
NooNoo: I mean idk wh yyou would ever but
Iamsodarncool: you mean boards flat against each other?
Iamsodarncool: certainly not intended, see through board should always work
Iamsodarncool: testing now
NooNoo: I mean the 2 do
NooNoo: but the 3rd is solid
NooNoo: oh sorry
NooNoo: I misunderstood how it worked
Iamsodarncool: cannot reproduce
NooNoo: I thought it made all board seethrough
Iamsodarncool: what did you misunderstand?
NooNoo: Also opening the pasue menu gives me a cursor
Iamsodarncool: ...intentional, you need to be able to click on stuff
NooNoo: when I close it with esc
NooNoo: Meaning I still have it
Iamsodarncool: a shite so it does
NooNoo: after I close it
Iamsodarncool: I thought I fixed that!!
Iamsodarncool: oh it appears I only fixed it on other menus, the new board and text edit ones. I'll apply the fix to the pause menu too
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmuu3
NooNoo: Not sure how
Iamsodarncool: CUNT
NooNoo: but this is selected indefinitley
Iamsodarncool: right clicking doesn't work?
Iamsodarncool: I thought I fixed that asshole
NooNoo: Removing it fixes it but yeah right clicking ddid not
Iamsodarncool: right clicking the stuck peg I mean
Iamsodarncool: and a reload would fix it... dammit. See if you can find out how to reproduce it
NooNoo: I cant seem to get it
Iamsodarncool: well good
Iamsodarncool: but also bad because now it's sneaky
NooNoo: Yeah no idea how it happened
NooNoo: Bam replicatedd
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmw50
Iamsodarncool: woohoo!
Iamsodarncool: how exactly
NooNoo: no fucking clue i was just connecting normally
Iamsodarncool: lol
Iamsodarncool: damn damn damn
NooNoo: REPLICATED AGAIN
Iamsodarncool: that bug haunted me for DAYS and I thought I'd banished it forever
Iamsodarncool: !!
NooNoo: Ok so
NooNoo: you select peg 1
NooNoo: hover over peg two
NooNoo: and quickly release and then reclick
NooNoo: now its not working wtf
Iamsodarncool: yeah cannot reproduce...
NooNoo: Okay I got
NooNoo: I got it
NooNoo: ig you highlight something
NooNoo: then hold left click of an existing object
NooNoo: ah what no
NooNoo: it seems so random
NooNoo: i got it 5 times doing that and now nothing
Iamsodarncool: fuck
NooNoo: its ddefinitley something to do with left click
NooNoo: cause i got it 3 more times
Iamsodarncool: hm
NooNoo: http://prntscr.com/hgmxfz
Iamsodarncool: nice collection
NooNoo: I dont think it matters what is connecting though
NooNoo: Okay so
NooNoo: I click and drag
NooNoo: then hold left click on the destination
NooNoo: then kind of roll my right mouse button
Iamsodarncool: hahahaha
Iamsodarncool: "I curse Buddha, I walk under a ladder 3 times..."
Iamsodarncool: just releasing the right mouse button doesn't work?
NooNoo: no
NooNoo: I can only get it if I fuck with my mouse
NooNoo: Do you know what i mean when I say roll
Iamsodarncool: sort of
NooNoo: so it is *kindda* pressed at some points but also pressed down really hard at other points
NooNoo: Idk man im going to go to sleep good luck
Iamsodarncool: thanks ben
Iamsodarncool: I FINALLY just fixed the wire intersection bug btw
Iamsodarncool: hooray
NooNoo: Awesome!
Iamsodarncool: goodnight ben
Iamsodarncool: thank you again for all your help
